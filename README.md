StoryScript is a (mainly) interpreted language

## How to install
First, Download the Source code. At the time of writing, I don't have any complete releases yet.

So, Just download the source code from Main branch. (And wish there is no bug)

**And also, You need Python installed**

Then you can just `python shell.py`, Then it will launch the shell, And you can use the language.

And at the time of writing, There is no File execution supported. So the only way to use the language now is use the shell.

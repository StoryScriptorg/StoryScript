StoryScript is a (mainly) interpreted language

## How to install
First, Download the Source code. At the time of writing, I don't have any complete releases yet.

So, Just download the source code from Main branch. (And wish there is no bug)

**And also, You need Python installed**

Then you can just `python shell.py`, Then it will launch the shell, And you can use the language.

And to execute a file, Use `python processor.py [filename]` and replace `[filename]` with the real File name.
For example:
```
python processor.py main.sts
```

## How to use the Language
